# nag_a_ram

A simple project aimed to find the anagrams of any given word with the least time possible

## Prerequisites

To build the app, you need the [gtk-framework](https://www.gtk.org/) installed on your system. To run the app, however, you only need the gtk shared objects.

## Built With

- C

```
C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. 
```

Refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) for more info on C

- GTK+

```
GTK (formerly GTK+, GIMP Toolkit) is a free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
```

Refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK) for more info on GTK+

- GLib

```
GLib is a bundle of three (formerly five) low-level system libraries written in C and developed mainly by GNOME. GLib's code was separated from GTK, so it can be used by software other than GNOME and has been developed in parallel ever since. 
```
